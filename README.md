### Thank you for this challenge! A few notes:

1. I embraced readability and separation of concerns for this project. With the multiple 
project layout, it is utilizing a more "clean architecture" approach meant more for enterprise
or long-term support.
2. I did not utilize feature and/or story branches with pull requests. Not sure if that was 
being looked for, but made it a bit easier for rapid development. I did prefix all commits 
with the requirement number.
3. I marked some of the tests with the "skip" attribute. I realize that we can see via history 
if a given test was no longer needed and removed. For brevity purposes, I left these in.
4. The examples provided in the requirements have been used as actual test scenarios, and 
included in the test framework.
